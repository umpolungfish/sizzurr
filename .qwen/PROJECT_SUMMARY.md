# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Remove problematic PDF and HTML conversion functionality from the sizzurr CLI tool and streamline it to only include core file relocation utilities with updated naming conventions.

## Key Knowledge
- The tool was originally named "SIZZURR" but was changed to lowercase "sizzurr"
- Two main commands remain: `c2p2` (file cutting/copying) and `relocate` (file relocation)
- The main description was updated from "SIZZURR - A collection of powerful command-line utilities" to "sizzurr - a pair of sharp cli scissors"
- The `c2p2` command help text was changed from "Move" to "cut" and all descriptions made lowercase
- Files removed: `sizzurr/pdf_to_md_converter.py` and `sizzurr/html_md_converter.py`
- The `pdf2md` and `html2md` commands were completely removed from CLI and documentation

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Completely removed PDF to Markdown conversion functionality that was causing hangs

- [DONE] Updated CLI help messages to use lowercase and changed "Move" to "cut" in c2p2 command

- [DONE] Created a git commit with message "Streamline sizzurr by removing pdf2md and html2md functionality, updating CLI descriptions to lowercase, and changing 'move' to 'cut'"

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Streamlined tool to only include core file manipulation commands
- [DONE] Updated documentation and CLI descriptions to match new terminology
